It could be sometimes hard, heavy, and time-consuming to build a native Android app with Android Studio even with templates. It is especially the case when you just want to create a simple tool/script. [Auto.js Pro](https://pro.autojs.org/) provides a solution using JavaScript as the script language. Based on some basic knowledge of Android development and JavaScript syntax, you can generate powerful automation tools with few learning costs in a much convenient way. This solution reminds me some words that the supervisor of my MS project for Computing Science used to say.

My Auto.js scripts contain all simple Android tools developed in this way. Generally, these tools do not have a carefully-designed icon, UI, etc, as they aim to solve basic problems for personal purposes. Please note that the code is licensed under [the GPL-3.0 License](./LICENSE).

## ❗ ATTENTION

> May I have your attention pls? 🔥

1. By 17 October 2021, everything looks good with Visual Studio Code (Version: 1.61.1) + Auto.js Pro V8.8.20-0. You need an Auto.js Pro account to build scripts on your own. I would like to thankfull acknowledge [@XQINGME](https://github.com/XQINGME) for allowing me to use his account for free.
2. The changelogs and the APK files built from the scripts can be found in the [Releases](../../releases) section. For more information about each tool, please refer to the README file in each folder.

Hope you could find it useful! 💖
